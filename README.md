# Flight Fare Forecasting Web App

## Abstract - 
Optimal timing for airline ticket purchasing from the consumer’s perspective is challenging principally because consumers do not have enough information for reasoning about the future price changes. In this project, I’ve mainly targeted to uncover underlying trends of flight prices in India using a data set where I’ve been provided with prices of flight tickets for various airlines and between various cities. Size of training set: 10683 records. Moreover, I’ll be hosting the API i.e app in a web environment where the app will predict the price/fare of a single flight ticket based on the user inputs taken.
